# Teamcity
Some helpfull teamcity stuff, which I use in day to day work and could share with world

## Usage
I will create those metarunners in separate folders, so, each metarunner along with accompanying files will reside in own folder. In folder `metarunner` one can find meta-runner itself (xml file, which needs to be placed in `<TeamCityDataDir>\config\projects\_Root\pluginData\metaRunners` for example, but target project can depend on use case). In folder `files` - one will be able to find required files
